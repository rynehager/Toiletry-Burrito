An open design for a roll-up leather toiletry set which accepts, upon slight modification, some other listed designs.

Make sure you have read the license details for this project before you use these designs.

[Simplified license avaliable here.](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

The simple version is you can do anything you want with these design files, so long as any tweaks you make are contributed back to the community! Don't let the attribution part scare you, that's really just a requirement in copyleft licenses to determine provenance and inheritance of the license from the earlier version. You don't have to credit me, just the previous design.
